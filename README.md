This project was built with create-react-app, typescript and redux-toolkit.

I make this project to practice AntD. Therefore, I use Less instead of SASS this time. 

There are some unfinished functions but I think it is quite alright for now.

Original Design belong to [Colorlib](https://colorlib.com/)
